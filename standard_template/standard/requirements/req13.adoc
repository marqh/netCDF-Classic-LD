An attribute may be declared by a metadata standard as a variable reference attribute.

In order to do this, the attribute shall declare itself in a resolveable RDF graph and include the statement:

 <{attribute}> rdfs:range <http://binary-array-ld.net/latest/Subject> .

It is also permissable to provide an rdfs:range statement targeting another resource and for that resource to declare that it is an rdfs:subClassOf bald:Subject, for example:

 <{attribute}> rdfs:range <{AClass}> .
 <{AClass}> rdfs:subClassOf <http://binary-array-ld.net/latest/Subject> .
