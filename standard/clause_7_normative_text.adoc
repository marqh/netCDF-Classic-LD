|*Requirement F-2* {set:cellbgcolor:#CACCCE}|/req/req-class-f/requirement-2 +
 +


Information on the NetCDF Coordinate Variables' data payload, which are limited to 1 Dimensional variables of data, shall be included in created graphs.

The first value of the coordinate variable data payload shall be included in the created graph, using the predicate:

`bald:arrayFirstValue`

Optionally the last value, if there is more than one value, of the coordinate variable data payload shall be included in the created graph, using the predicate:

`bald:arrayLastValue`


The first and last positions are taken from the order of the coordinate variable array values, as presented within the file.


If the value is encoded as a missing value, then no statement is included within the metadata graph.
