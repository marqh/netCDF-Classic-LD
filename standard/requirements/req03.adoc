A list of prefixes, defined within a netCDF file, within a single variable or group that is referenced by the global root group attribute:

`+bald__isPrefixedBy+`

shall be interpreted as Prefixes and used to interpret prefixed contents within the file.

If a prefix variable or group is defined, that prefix variable shall contain the prefix:

`+bald__ = https://www.opengis.net/def/binary-array-ld/+`

Prefixes defined within a prefix variable shall be used as prefixes for the parsing of that file.

The definition of multiple prefix resources within a single file is invalid in this standard.  Implementations may choose to combine prefix collections in invalid cases, but no precendence is implied, and prefix conflict is unresolved.
